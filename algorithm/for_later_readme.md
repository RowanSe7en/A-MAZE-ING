**A-MAZE-ING** is a configurable, pip-installable Python maze generator. Given a plain-text configuration file, it:

1. Parses width, height, entry/exit coordinates, and generation options
2. Generates a random maze using a **Recursive Backtracker (DFS)** algorithm
3. Optionally enforces a **perfect maze** (a spanning-tree maze with exactly one path between any two cells)
4. Embeds a hidden **"42" pattern** made of fully closed cells
5. Solves the maze using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path
6. Saves the maze to a file using a **hexadecimal wall encoding**
7. Optionally renders a **visual display** of the maze in the terminal

---

## Features

---

## Maze Model & Encoding

### Cell Wall Representation

Each cell in the maze has **four walls**: North, East, South, and West. These are encoded as a **4-bit integer** (0–15), where each bit represents the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of a wall.

```
Bit position:  3    2    1    0
Direction:     W    S    E    N
```

| Bit | Direction |
|-----|-----------|
| 0   | North     |
| 1   | East      |
| 2   | South     |
| 3   | West      |

### Wall Encoding Table

| Walls Present | Binary | Hex |
|---------------|--------|-----|
| None          | `0000` | `0` |
| North only    | `0001` | `1` |
| East only     | `0010` | `2` |
| South only    | `0100` | `4` |
| West only     | `1000` | `8` |
| All walls     | `1111` | `F` |

### Example

A cell with its West and South walls intact:

```
binary: 1100  →  hex: C
         ││
         │└── South wall present
         └─── West wall present
```

### Grid Structure

The maze is stored as a 2D list:

```python
maze[y][x] = int  # value from 0 to 15
```

At initialization, every cell starts with all four walls intact (`0xF = 15`):

```
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF | 0xF |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

The generation algorithm progressively removes walls between adjacent cells to carve out paths.

---

## Algorithms

### Maze Generation

#### Recursive Backtracker (DFS)

The default and primary generation algorithm is the **Recursive Backtracker**, also known as the **Depth-First Search (DFS) maze generator**.

**How it works:**

```
1. Initialize all cells with all walls present (value = 0xF).
2. Create a visited grid, all set to False.
3. Start from the entry cell. Mark it as visited.
4. Randomly choose an unvisited neighbouring cell.
5. Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen neighbour.
6. Move to the neighbour and repeat from step 4.
7. If no unvisited neighbours exist, backtrack to the previous cell.
8. Repeat until all cells have been visited.
```

**Visited grid at start:**

```
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |   F = False (unvisited)
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |  F  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
```

**Properties:**

| Property              | Value                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Maze type             | Perfect maze (spanning tree)               |
| Loops                 | None                                       |
| Isolated cells        | None                                       |
| Path between any two cells | Exactly one                          |
| Graph theory model    | Spanning tree                              |

**Why this algorithm?**

- Simple to implement
- Always produces perfect mazes
- Easy to control via a random seed for reproducibility

---

### Shortest Path Solving

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

The shortest path from `ENTRY` to `EXIT` is computed using **BFS**, which guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

**How it works:**

```
1. Start from ENTRY. Add it to a queue.
2. Explore all accessible neighbours level by level.
3. Track each cell's parent to reconstruct the path.
4. Stop when EXIT is reached.
5. Trace back through the parent map to build the path.
```

**Path encoding:**

Each step in the path is encoded as a cardinal direction:

| Symbol | Direction |
|--------|-----------|
| `N`    | North     |
| `E`    | East      |
| `S`    | South     |
| `W`    | West      |

**Example path:** `EESSWN`

```
Start →→ ↓↓ ← ↑ → End
         (E E S S W N)
```

---

### Non-Perfect Mazes

When `PERFECT=False`, a **braided maze** is produced. This starts from a perfect maze and then removes additional walls to introduce **loops and multiple valid paths** between cells.

**Approach:**

```
1. Generate a perfect maze using the Recursive Backtracker.
2. Identify dead-end cells (cells with only one open passage).
3. Randomly remove one of their remaining walls to create a loop.
4. Repeat for a configurable number of dead ends.
```

**Result:** A maze with cycles — there will be more than one path between some pairs of cells.

| Property       | Perfect Maze         | Non-Perfect (Braided) Maze     |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Loops          | None                 | Yes                             |
| Dead ends      | Many                 | Fewer                           |
| Paths          | Exactly one per pair | Multiple possible               |
| Difficulty     | Clear challenge      | Can be easier to navigate       |

---

## The "42" Pattern

Every generated maze embeds a hidden **"42"** shape made of **fully closed cells** (all four walls intact, value `0xF`).

```
Example shape of "42" embedded in maze cells:

  ████  ██████
  █  █      █
  ████      █
     █  ██████
  ████
     █  ██████
  ████      █
     █  ██████
```

These closed cells form the outline of the digits **4** and **2** within the maze grid. If the maze dimensions are too small to embed the pattern, a warning is printed and the pattern is skipped.

---

## Output File Format

The output file consists of:

1. **Maze rows** — one row per line, each cell encoded as a single hex digit
2. A blank line separator
3. **ENTRY** coordinates
4. **EXIT** coordinates
5. **PATH** — the shortest path as a direction string

### Example Output File

```
9A3F
8C21
77B0

0,0
19,14
EESSWN
```

### Format Breakdown

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  9A3F          ← row 0 of maze   │
│  8C21          ← row 1 of maze   │
│  77B0          ← row 2 of maze   │
│                ← blank line       │
│  0,0           ← ENTRY           │
│  19,14         ← EXIT            │
│  EESSWN        ← shortest PATH   │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each character in a maze row is a **hexadecimal digit (0–F)** representing the wall configuration of that cell.

# 🧱 My Way of Drawing Mazes (ASCII Rendering Philosophy)

## 🎯 Overview

My rendering approach is not about drawing the maze *as a whole*, but about constructing it **cell by cell**, layer by layer.

Instead of thinking in terms of global structures, I treat each cell as a **self-contained unit** responsible for contributing:

- Its **ceiling (top wall)**
- Its **left wall**
- Its **content (inside the cell)**

This creates a clean, deterministic rendering pipeline.

---

## 🔄 The Rendering Flow

For each row in the maze, I perform **two distinct passes**:

### 1️⃣ Top Pass — Drawing Ceilings

For every cell:
- I always start with a `"+"` (corner)
- Then decide:
  - `"---"` → if there is a **top wall**
  - `"   "` → if there is **no wall**

So visually, each cell contributes:

+---

or

👉 This pass builds the **horizontal structure** of the maze.

---

### 2️⃣ Middle Pass — Left Wall + Content

Now for the same row, I render the **body** of each cell:

Each cell contributes:
- A **left wall**:
  - `"|"` if it exists
  - `" "` if open
- A **content block** (always 3 characters wide)

#### Possible contents:
- `" S "` → Start
- `" E "` → Exit
- `" . "` → Path
- `" # "` → Special / blocked
- `"   "` → Empty

👉 This pass builds the **navigable space** of the maze.

---

## ⚠️ The Subtle Detail: The Missing Right Wall

While iterating cells, I only draw **left walls**.

That means:
> The **right wall of the last cell is never drawn during the loop**

So I explicitly fix this at the end of each row:

- After finishing all cells → I check the last cell
- Then draw its **right wall manually**

This ensures the maze is **properly closed on the right side**.

---

## 🧩 Final Step — The Bottom Border

After all rows are processed, there is still one thing missing:

> The **bottom boundary of the maze**

So I perform one final pass:
- Repeating `+---` for each column
- Ending with a final `"+"`

This creates a solid **floor** for the maze.






---

# 🧩 Maze Representation Problem: ASCII vs Emoji Blocks

## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given a maze that can be rendered in two fundamentally different ways:

1. **ASCII Representation** — using characters like `+`, `-`, and `|`
2. **Emoji Block Representation** — using square blocks like `⬛`, `⬜`, `🟦`, `🟩`

At first glance, both representations describe the same structure.  
However, they behave very differently when it comes to **movement, scaling, and geometry**.

---

## 🧱 Example 1: Same Maze, Two Worlds

### ASCII Maze

### Emoji Maze

⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
⬛🟦⬜⬜⬛
⬛⬛⬛⬜⬛
⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛
⬛⬜⬛⬜⬛
⬛⬜⬜⬜⬛
⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛


---

## ⚙️ Core Observation

### ASCII World
- Walls are **thin** → just lines (`|` and `-`)
- Cells are **implicitly spaced**
- Movement is **direct and linear**
  - Move right → `+1` column
- Grid is **compact**

### Emoji Block World
- Walls are **thick** → full blocks (`⬛`)
- Cells occupy **actual space**
- Movement is **scaled**
  - Move right → **2 steps**
- Grid is **expanded**

---

## 📏 The Scaling Problem

Let’s define:
- `n` = number of logical cells in one dimension

### ASCII Grid Size

width ≈ n


### Emoji Grid Size

width ≈ 2n + 1


### Why?

Because:
- Each **cell becomes a block**
- Each **wall also becomes a block**
- You alternate: `wall → cell → wall → cell → ... → wall`

So:

[cell, wall, cell, wall, ..., cell] → becomes → 2n + 1

# 🔢 Defining the “42”: When and How the Shape Is Planted

## 🎯 Overview

The “42” is not discovered during maze generation.  
It is **explicitly planted** into the grid *before* the maze is carved.

This is a crucial design decision:

> The maze adapts around the “42” — not the other way around.

---

## ⏱️ When It Happens

The sequence is intentional:

1. Initialize the maze structure  
2. **Mark the cells that will form “42” withe the value 16**  
3. Run the maze generation algorithm  

👉 This ordering ensures:

- The “42” is treated as **already occupied**
- The generator avoids breaking or overwriting it
- The shape becomes a **fixed artifact inside the maze**

---

## 📍 Where It Starts

The placement begins from a computed origin:

- Roughly centered in the grid
ft_y = int((height / 2) - 2.5)
        ft_x = int((width / 2) - 3.5)
- Slightly offset to account for the width of “4” and “2”

This origin is not arbitrary — it ensures:
- The digits are **visually centered**
- There is enough space on both sides
- The structure does not collide with borders

---

## ✍️ How the “4” Is Drawn

The “4” is constructed as a **sequence of directional strokes**:

- A vertical descent
- A horizontal extension
- A vertical ascent
- A final downward extension

👉 This mimics how you would *draw a 4 by hand*:
- Build the spine
- Add the crossbar
- Complete the structure

Each step:
- Moves a cursor (`x`, `y`)
- Marks the current cell
- Records it as part of the “42”

---

## ✍️ How the “2” Is Drawn

After finishing the “4”, you shift horizontally to start the “2”.

The “2” follows a different pattern:

- A top horizontal stroke
- A downward curve (stepwise vertical movement)
- A middle horizontal shift
- Another descent
- A final base stroke

👉 It’s not a curve mathematically —  
but a **discrete approximation using grid steps**

---

## 🧱 What “Marking a Cell” Means

Each selected cell is:

1. **Flagged as visited**
   - Prevents the maze generator from reusing it

2. **Tagged in the maze data**
   - Gives it a distinct identity (later rendered as `#` or `🟦`)

3. **Stored in a coordinate list**
   - Enables special handling during rendering (like connectivity fixes)

# 🔷 The “42” Problem: Why the Blue Blocks Break — and How They Become Whole

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Inside the emoji-rendered maze, a special pattern is embedded:

> The number **“42”**, drawn using blue blocks (`🟦`)

At the logical level, this shape is **correctly defined**.  
But when rendered, something feels off:

> ❌ The blue blocks appear **fragmented**  
> ❌ The digits look **broken and disconnected**

---

## 🧩 The Core Issue

This is not a data problem.  
It is a **rendering consistency problem**.

Your maze operates on a hybrid model:

- 🧠 Logical grid → cells with meaning (`16` for special cells)
- 🎨 Visual grid → expanded emoji blocks (walls + spaces)

And here lies the mismatch:

> The **“42” exists in logical space**,  
> but is rendered in a **scaled geometric space**

---

## ⚠️ Why the Blue Blocks Get Separated

### 1️⃣ Cell-Centric Rendering

Your system draws:
- Top walls
- Left walls
- Cell content

Each cell is treated **independently**.

👉 That works for walls and paths…  
👉 But **fails for shapes that must span multiple cells**

---

### 2️⃣ Missing Continuity Rules

The renderer originally answers:
> “What is this cell?”

But it does **not ask**:
> “Is this cell part of a continuous structure?”

So even if two blue cells are adjacent logically:


[🟦][🟦]


They may render as:


🟦 ⬛ 🟦


Because:
- A wall or spacing rule is still applied between them
- No exception is made for **same-type neighbors**

---

### 3️⃣ Walls Interfere With Shapes

Walls are absolute in your system:
- They are drawn regardless of semantic meaning

So the “42” gets **cut apart by walls** that:
- Exist structurally
- But should be **ignored visually** for this pattern

---

## 💡 The Conceptual Fix

The solution is not about adding complexity —  
it’s about adding **awareness of continuity**.

---

### 🔗 1. Horizontal Continuity

When two adjacent cells both belong to the “42”:

> The boundary between them should **disappear**

Instead of:

🟦 ⬛ 🟦


You get:

🟦🟦


👉 The shape becomes **visually connected**

---

### 🔗 2. Vertical Continuity

Similarly, when stacking:


🟦
🟦


You must ensure:
- No artificial ceiling/floor splits them
- No wall overrides their connection

👉 This preserves vertical strokes of the digits

---

### 🧠 3. Priority Shift

You implicitly introduced a new rule:

> **Shape continuity > Maze wall rules**

This is the key design decision.

Instead of:
- “Walls always win”

You moved to:
- “If this is part of the 42, preserve the shape first”

## 🔄 What Changed Conceptually

Before:
- Rendering was **local**
- Each cell ignored its neighbors’ identity

After:
- Rendering became **context-aware**
- Cells now consider:
  - Their **neighbors**
  - Their **shared role** in a structure

---

## 🧪 Result

### Before
- Broken digits
- Isolated blue pixels
- Visual noise

## 🧠 Insight

This reveals an important principle:

> A maze renderer is not just about walls and paths —  
> it is also about **semantic layers on top of geometry**

You effectively added a second layer:

- Layer 1 → Maze topology  
- Layer 2 → Visual pattern (the “42”)

And the second layer now:
> **overrides the first when necessary**

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

The “42” was never wrong.

It only *looked* wrong because:
- The renderer treated it like ordinary cells
- Instead of a **connected structure**

By introducing **continuity awareness**, you transformed:

> ❌ A set of isolated blocks  
> into  
> ✅ A coherent, readable shape

---

## ✨ Final Thought

Just like your ASCII-to-emoji transformation introduced **spatial scaling**,  
this problem introduced **semantic rendering**:

> Not everything in the grid should be treated equally.

Some things — like “42” —  
deserve to stay whole.
